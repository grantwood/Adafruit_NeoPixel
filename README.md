Adafruit NeoPixel library - Galago Fork
=========================

I'm in the process of porting this to run on a [Galago][galago]. To date, there are no changes to share.  I'll update this when progress has been made.

--------------------------------

Arduino library for controlling single-wire-based LED pixels and strip such as the [Adafruit 60 LED/meter Digital LED strip][strip], the [Adafruit FLORA RGB Smart Pixel][flora], the [Adafruit Breadboard-friendly RGB Smart Pixel][pixel], the [Adafruit NeoPixel Stick][stick], and the [Adafruit NeoPixel Shield][shield].

After downloading, rename folder to 'Adafruit_NeoPixel' and install in Arduino Libraries folder. Restart Arduino IDE, then open File->Sketchbook->Library->Adafruit_NeoPixel->strandtest sketch.
